# Hunt the thimble
Simulation of popular *hunt the thimble* game made with Python.

## Game Rules:
You must guide the violet cube to a key through the 10x10 board. <br> The key position and the cube position are random. <br> The key is hidden, so you can't see it. <br> Some tips will appear after you move at least one square. <br> The goal is to reach the key in as few moves as possible. <br> Moves are counted even if you try to move out of the board.
<hr>
There are some special squares on the board. <br> When you land on one of these squares, you can choose what action to take. <br> If you choose A, the board will shuffle randomly. <br> If you choose P, all squares on the board will swap their coordinates.
